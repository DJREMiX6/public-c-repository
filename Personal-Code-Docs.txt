specifier                   Description             Characters extracted
i                           Integer                 Any number of digits, optionally preceded by a sign (+ or -).
                                                    Decimal digits assumed by default (0-9), but a 0 prefix introduces octal digits (0-7),
                                                    and 0x hexadecimal digits (0-f).
                                                    Signed argument.

d or u	                    Decimal integer         Any number of decimal digits (0-9),
                                                    optionally preceded by a sign (+ or -).
                                                    d is for a signed argument, and u for an unsigned.

o	                        Octal Integer           Any number of octal digits (0-7), optionally preceded by a sign (+ or -).
                                                    Unsigned argument.

x	                        Hexadecimal integer	    Any number of hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, A-F), 
                                                    optionally preceded by 0x or 0X, and all optionally preceded by a sign (+ or -).
                                                    Unsigned argument.

f, e, g	                    Floating point number	A series of decimal digits, optionally containing a decimal point, 
                                                    optionally preceeded by a sign (+ or -) and optionally followed by the e or E character and a decimal integer 
                                                    (or some of the other sequences supported by strtod).
                                                    Implementations complying with C99 also support hexadecimal floating-point format when preceded by 0x or 0X.

c	                        Character	            The next character. If a width other than 1 is specified, the function reads exactly width 
                                                    characters and stores them in the successive locations of the array passed as argument. No null character 
                                                    is appended at the end.

s	                        String                  String of characters
                                                    Any number of non-whitespace characters, stopping at the first whitespace character found. 
                                                    A terminating null character is automatically added at the end of the stored sequence.

p	                        Pointer address	        A sequence of characters representing a pointer. 
                                                    The particular format used depends on the system and library implementation, 
                                                    but it is the same as the one used to format %p in fprintf.

[characters]	            Scanset	                Any number of the characters specified between the brackets.
                                                    A dash (-) that is not the first character may produce non-portable behavior in some library implementations.

[^characters]	            Negated scanset	        Any number of characters none of them specified as characters between the brackets.

n	                        Count	                No input is consumed.
